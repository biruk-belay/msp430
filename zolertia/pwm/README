This program uses PWM to dim and brighten a led connected to TA1 (P1.6) of MSP430f2617. The timer runs with 1MHz clock. TACCR0 is set to 10000 with up counting mode and set/reset method is used to generate a 50Hz PWM signal. The width of the pulse is varied by periodically increasing and decreasing the TACCR1 value.

Different count modes with different OUT modes can be used to generate different PWM signals.
